How to Navigate Webpage:

1. The homepage
It has two options: a "create user" button that redirects to a form
which creates a new user and adds it to the database, and a "login" form
which takes a username and then redirects to said user's page. This works
with a postgres database of all users, which you can view by manually 
going to /users. You can also access a master list of all POI's by going
to /pois.

2. Once you create a user and login
You will see an html page with your data and six buttons underneath. The
first two buttons interact with the user's data, allowing you to edit your
data or delete your account.

3. The other four buttons
Allow for interaction with POI's. You can add a POI, remove a POI, edit a POI
or view your current POI. The first three use forms to collect input data
from the user and update the database accordingly, whereas viewing your POI
just pulls up a list of the POI's for your user without requiring an input.
